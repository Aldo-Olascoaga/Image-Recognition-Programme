# Image-Recognition-Programme

• This programme is able to recognise animals thanks to some Deep Learning concepts applied on it.

• Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks were employed to get the best predictions possible.

• Lots and lots of images were uploaded in order to train the algorithm and make the most accurate predictions.
